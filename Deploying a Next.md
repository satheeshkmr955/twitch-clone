Deploying a Next.js application in production using Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx as a reverse proxy, and Let's Encrypt SSL certificates requires a few steps. Here's a detailed guide to help you set this up.

### Prerequisites:
1. **Next.js application**: Your Next.js project is ready for deployment.
2. **Docker & Docker Compose**: Installed on the host machine.
3. **Domain Name**: A domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`).
4. **Ports**: You’ll expose ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) for Nginx to handle.
5. **Certbot**: To generate SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

### Directory Structure
Let's assume your directory structure looks like this:

```
/project-root
  ├── Dockerfile
  ├── docker-compose.yml
  ├── nginx/
  │    ├── default.conf
  ├── nextjs/
  │    └── ... (Next.js app files)
  └── .dockerignore
```

### Step 1: Create Dockerfile for Next.js App

You need a `Dockerfile` to build and serve your Next.js application.

```Dockerfile
# Step 1: Build Stage
FROM node:18 AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY nextjs/package.json nextjs/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of your Next.js app
COPY nextjs ./

# Build the app
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Production Stage
FROM node:18-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install production dependencies
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json /app/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the built app from the builder
COPY --from=builder /app/.next /app/.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public /app/public

# Expose the port the app will run on
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the Next.js application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Step 2: Configure Nginx

You need to configure Nginx to reverse proxy traffic from port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to the Next.js app running on port 3000.

**nginx/default.conf:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/chain.pem;

    # SSL Settings
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers 'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256';
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://nextjs:3000; # The Next.js container
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Docker Compose File

You will define the services in the `docker-compose.yml` file. We will define three services:

- **nextjs**: The Next.js app.
- **nginx**: The Nginx reverse proxy.
- **certbot**: The Let's Encrypt Certbot to manage SSL certificates.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nextjs:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: nextjs
    expose:
      - "3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    restart: always

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: nginx
    depends_on:
      - nextjs
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - ./nginx/certificates:/etc/letsencrypt
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    restart: always

  certbot:
    image: certbot/certbot
    container_name: certbot
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/certificates:/etc/letsencrypt
    entrypoint: "/bin/sh -c 'trap exit TERM; while :; do certbot renew; sleep 12h & wait $${!}; done;'"
    restart: always

  nginx-proxy:
    image: jwilder/nginx-proxy
    container_name: nginx-proxy
    environment:
      - DEFAULT_HOST=yourdomain.com
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
```

### Step 4: SSL Certificate Generation Using Certbot

To generate the SSL certificates, you’ll need to run Certbot with the Nginx container. Here's how to do it:

1. **Start Nginx and Certbot Containers:**
   Run `docker-compose up -d` to bring up the Nginx and Certbot services.
   
2. **Generate the SSL Certificate**:
   
   Run the following command to generate the certificate:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec certbot certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot --email your-email@domain.com --agree-tos --no-eff-email -d yourdomain.com
   ```

   This command tells Certbot to use the webroot plugin to verify the domain ownership and generate SSL certificates.

3. **Configure Automatic Certificate Renewal**:
   The `certbot` container is already set up to check and renew the certificates every 12 hours as part of the `docker-compose.yml` configuration.

### Step 5: Start the Docker Compose Services

Once everything is set up, you can start the services with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the Next.js application, the Nginx reverse proxy, and the Certbot service.

### Step 6: Verify SSL

After everything is up and running, you should be able to visit `https://yourdomain.com` and see the Next.js app being served with a valid SSL certificate.

### Optional: Set up Docker Networking (If Needed)

In case you face issues with internal networking between containers, you might want to add a custom network in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
```

### Notes:

1. **Volume Persistence**: Make sure you persist your certificates and Nginx configurations across container restarts. The `./nginx/certificates` volume will store SSL certificates, and the Nginx config is stored in `./nginx/default.conf`.
   
2. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure your domain (`yourdomain.com`) is properly pointing to your server's IP address.

3. **Docker Logs**: You can check the logs of each service using:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs <service-name>
   ```

### Conclusion

With this setup, you now have a production-ready environment for your Next.js application running inside Docker with Nginx reverse proxy, SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt, and automatic certificate renewal.
